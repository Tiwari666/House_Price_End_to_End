    "Dockerization means packing the project (code + libraries + settings) into a neat little box called a Docker container so it can run anywhere, without breaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker helps package the entire project (Flask app, model, dependencies) into a container that can run anywhere — the machine, server, or the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes your code, Flask app, trained model, and all dependencies in one container.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, it runs the same on your laptop, a friend’s PC, or a cloud server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of your project like a cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, if you move the cake to someone else’s kitchen, it might fall apart because they don't have the same oven, ingredients, or temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is like a cake box — it keeps everything (recipe, ingredients, tools) safe inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now anyone can take the box and enjoy the same cake — on any computer."
